Timelapse For Aperture
======================

Timelapse for Aperture is a simple, open-source Export Plugin for Apple's Aperture photo editing
software that allows you to export images as a time-lapse movie.

Timelapse for Aperture requires Mac OS X 10.6 or higher.

To install Timelapse, place it in ~/Library/Application Support/Aperture/Plug-Ins/Export and 
relaunch Aperture if it's already running. To use, select some images then choose File -> Export -> 
Time Lapse then select your preferred frame rate.

The resulting movie will be sized according to the images generated by the chosen Export Preset.
